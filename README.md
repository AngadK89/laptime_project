Given any trackâ€™s information:
- Track length
- Number of corners
- No. Of high, mid, low speed corners
- Track rotation
- Number of straights 
- Length of straights

Weather info:
- Track temp 
- Air temp 
- Rainfall 
- Humidity 

And lap info:
- Sprint/race/quali session
- Stint number (later stints are usually faster in races due to less fuel)
- Tyre compound 
- Tyre age 
- Track status

Predict the lap time of the driver on the track.


Here, I need to:
 - Add quali events to dataframe
 - Check correct session & weather info 
 - Figure out how to collect track data
